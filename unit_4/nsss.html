	<p>Moped Definition - A moped is defined as either a pedal bicycle with a helper motor or a non-pedal bicycle with a motor, which has all of the following characteristics:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Have a cylinder capacity of no more than 50 cubic centimeters.</li>
		<li>Have an automatic transmission.</li>
		<li>Be capable of a maximum speed of no more than 30 miles per hour.</li>
		<li>Comply with all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>*If the maximum speed of the motorized bicycle/moped is greater than 30 miles per hour but less than 40 miles per hour and it is certified to meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards as a motorcycle, it may qualify as a Limited Use Motorcycle.*</p>

	<p>*If a motorized bicycle/moped no longer has a restrictor plate (a mechanical part that limits the speed of a motorized bicycle/moped), the vehicle will be re-classified as a motorcycle. In this case, the customer must register, title, and insure the motor vehicle as a motorcycle and obtain a motorcycle license. Any customer who registers a motorcycle as a motorized bicycle/moped may be guilty of operating an unregistered, uninsured, uninspected, and untitled motor vehicle and the motorcycle may be towed and stored at the customer's expense.*</p>
